	 * order with same {@code pricePerKilo} in O(log n) as keys are sorted in
	 * TreeMap. If so, append your new order to existing list, or else create a new

	 * To find the respective map (based on order's type) we need O(1) time
	 * (currently we have only 2 keys, BUY/SELL). Based on it, query respective
	 * Treemap, to know in which LinkedList given order is residing with in log(n)
	 * time (as keys are ordered in TreeMap, "get" operation would take log(n)). As
	 * there could be more than one order at same price so traverse the LinkedList
	 * linearly and delete the order so O(n) where n is list of orders at a given
	 * price. In case of single key and being cancelled, remove operation would take
